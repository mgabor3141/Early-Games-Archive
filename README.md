# Early Games

An archive of some of the many small games I made 2011-2014.

Some of these games were created for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) 48 hour game jam.
Check the linked LD page of these games to see their competition scores, more screenshots and some nice comments.

## Tortaminátor
_September 2011_

A remake of another sokoban game called ["Cheese Terminator"](https://people.inf.elte.hu/hotsaai/Web2bead/SajtTerminator/)
featuring cake instead of cheese. Arguably improved by adding portals to in a sequel.
There are edge cases with portals where cake can get deleted,
in those cases the mouse ate them according to the lore.

## Avoid the missiles!
_December 2011_

A surprisingly challenging bullet hell game.
Let me know if you can get a high score of over 10 seconds on the hardest difficulty.

## Rules
_February 2012_

To this day I believe the particle system in this game is one of the most satisfying things I've ever developed.

Controls not listed:<br/>
`W` noclip<br/>
`Q` debug overlay

## LD24: Geometry
_August 2012_<br/>
Theme: Evolution

A game similar in both theme and gameplay to Geometry Wars.
Interestingly I hadn't heard of Geometry Wars until one of the LD comments
pointed out the similarity to me.

Don't forget that you can buy upgrades by pressing `Spacebar`!
