# Early Games

An archive of some of the many small games I made 2011-2014.

Some of these games were created for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) 48 hour game jam.
Check the linked LD page of these games to see their competition scores, more screenshots and some nice comments.

### LD24: Geometry
August 2012<br/>
Theme: Evolution

A game similar in both theme and gameplay to Geometry Wars.
Interestingly I hadn't heard of Geometry Wars until one of the comments
pointed it out to me.

Don't forget that you can buy upgrades by pressing `Spacebar`!

## Others

### Tortaminátor
September 2011

A remake of another sokoban game called ["Cheese Terminator"](https://people.inf.elte.hu/hotsaai/Web2bead/SajtTerminator/)
featuring cake instead of cheese. Arguably improved by adding portals to the sequel.
There are edge cases with portals where cakes can get deleted,
in those cases the mouse ate them according to the lore.

### "Game"
December 2011

A surprisingly challenging bullet hell game.
Let me know if you can get a high score of over 10 seconds on the hardest difficulty.

### Rules
February 2012

To this day I believe the particle system here is one of the most satisfying things I've ever developed.

Controls not listed:<br/>
`W` noclip<br/>
`Q` debug overlay
